# PROJECT3_FYS-STK4155
## Classifying Epileptic Seizures with Machine Learning Algorithms
### Repository for third project in FYS-STK4155: Applied data analysis and machine learning.
#### Authors: Teah Kaasa McLean, Marius Helvig Havgar & Ã…smund Danielsen Kvitvang

The repository consist of two main parts, namely the **report** and **code**. 
It also contains the *data.csv*-file with all EEG-data as well as three subdirectories, namely
* **img**, which contains images generated throughout this project.
* **img-gif**, which contains *50* images and one gif showing the accuracy difference for XGBoost when tuning the learning rate.
* **npy-data**, which contains data saved when running program so that the other functions implemented may load this data instead of creating new.
The code within *EEG_analysis.py* is built up as a simple console menu for testing.
